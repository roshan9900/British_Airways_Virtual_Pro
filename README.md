# Understanding the Variables that Shape Flight Booking Choices

**Introduction**:
In this project, I embarked on a journey to extract meaningful insights from a collection of 50,000 data samples using a combination of data preprocessing, machine learning techniques, and data visualization.

**Introduction**:
In this project, I undertook an in-depth analysis to predict customer bookings for British Airways. Leveraging a dataset of 50,000 samples and employing a holistic approach, I aimed to understand the factors influencing booking decisions. 

**Key Project Steps**:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: I began by exploring the dataset to gain insights into its characteristics and distribution. EDA helped in understanding the data's structure and identifying patterns.
2. Check EDA NoteBook: https://github.com/roshan9900/British_Airways_Virtual_Pro/blob/main/EDA.ipynb

2. **Handling Imbalanced Dataset**: Recognizing the importance of balanced data for accurate predictions, I implemented techniques to address class imbalance, ensuring a fair representation of both booking and non-booking cases.

3. **Feature Engineering**: To enhance the predictive power of the model, I crafted new features from the existing dataset, potentially capturing hidden patterns and relationships.

4. **Feature Selection Techniques**: Employing feature selection methods, I identified the most influential variables for predicting booking behavior, streamlining the model and improving its efficiency.

5. **Classification Algorithms**: I applied various classification algorithms to build predictive models. These models were trained on the preprocessed data to classify whether a customer is likely to book a ticket with British Airways. Random Forest gave best accuracy of 92%.

6. **Feature Importance Analysis**: After model training, I assessed feature importance to determine which attributes have the most significant impact on the booking decision. This analysis provided valuable insights into customer preferences and behaviors.

**Coclusion**:
Beyond its specific application to predicting British Airways bookings, our project exemplifies a versatile approach that can be adapted to diverse real-world scenarios. Whether it's forecasting sales, mitigating risks, optimizing processes, or understanding customer sentiment, the principles of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning remain potent tools for data-driven decision-making.

In today's data-centric world, the ability to extract valuable insights from data is a competitive advantage. This project underscores the transformative potential of data analysis, offering actionable intelligence that can inform strategic decisions, enhance services, and drive meaningful business outcomes. As we continue to harness the power of data, we open new horizons for innovation and problem-solving across a multitude of domains.
